This program will render an HTML page with my favorite movie’s. It displays the movie, the movie title, short summary/storyline and upon clicking on the movie poster a trailer for the movie will play. 


To run the program do the following:


1. Make sure you have the following files: entertainment.py, movie.py and fresh_tomatoes.py. Also, make sure to place all the files in the same directory before trying to run the program. Please note since the original fresh_tomatoes.py has been modified the fresh_tomatoes.py file provided here must be used to see the custom styling that has been added. 
2. Once you have the all the files and they are all in the same directory. To run the program, open Python IDLE and then open the entertainment.py file from the ‘File’ menu. Then once file is loaded in IDLE choose ‘Run’ from the menu and then choose ‘Run Module’ . 
3. The program should run and render the movie trailer site in the a browser.
